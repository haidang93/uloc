/// Base interface for all ULoC providers.
///
/// This abstract class defines the foundational structure for both
/// stateful and stateless providers in the ULoC (Universal Logic Component)
/// architecture. It provides common lifecycle hooks, context-aware routing,
/// argument access, and provider traversal capabilities.
///
/// ### Lifecycle
/// - The `onCreate()` method is called immediately upon construction.
/// - Subclasses can override `onCreate()` to perform setup logic.
///
/// ### Navigation Utilities
/// Includes navigation methods such as:
/// - `getTo()`, `off()`, `offAll()` for named route navigation
/// - `pop()` and `popUntil()` for back navigation
///
/// ### Arguments & Query Access
/// - Use `arguments` and `ulocArguments` to access route arguments.
/// - Use `query()` and `queryParametersAll` to retrieve URL query parameters.
///
/// ### Provider Traversal
/// - `findAncestorProviderOfType<P>()` allows retrieving providers
///   from previous routes, optionally filtered by location.
///
/// ### Example:
/// ```dart
/// class MyProvider extends ULoCProviderInterface {
///   MyProvider(BuildContext context) : super(context);
///
///   @override
///   void onCreate() {
///     super.onCreate();
///     // Custom setup
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This class should be extended by custom provider implementations
/// and is not meant to be used directly.
abstract class ULoCProviderInterface {
  /// The [BuildContext] associated with this provider.
  ///
  /// This context is typically tied to the widget tree from which the
  /// provider is initialized. It is used for accessing route arguments,
  /// navigation, and other context-based operations within the provider.
  ///
  /// Always available after the provider is constructed.
  BuildContext context;

  /// Creates a new [ULoCProviderInterface] with the given [context].
  ///
  /// Automatically calls [onCreate] during construction, allowing subclasses
  /// to perform initialization logic as soon as the provider is created.
  ///
  /// Subclasses should call `super(context)` in their constructors to ensure
  /// proper setup.
  ULoCProviderInterface(this.context) {
    onCreate();
  }

  /// Called immediately after the provider is constructed.
  ///
  /// Use this method to perform any initial setup or logic that should
  /// happen as soon as the provider is created. This includes setting
  /// default values, fetching initial data, or registering listeners.
  ///
  /// Subclasses **must** call `super.onCreate()` when overriding this method,
  /// as it ensures essential base initialization runs.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// void onCreate() {
  ///   super.onCreate();
  ///   // Custom setup here
  /// }
  /// ```
  @mustCallSuper
  void onCreate() {
    printLog('Created');
  }

  /// Returns the arguments passed to the route.
  ///
  /// If the route arguments are wrapped in a [UlocArguments] object,
  /// this extracts and returns the underlying `flutterArguments`.
  /// Otherwise, it returns the raw `routeArguments` as-is.
  ///
  /// This is useful when you want to access the actual data passed
  /// to a screen regardless of how it's internally packaged.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final args = arguments;
  /// if (args is MyDataModel) {
  ///   // Use args
  /// }
  /// ```
  Object? get arguments {
    if (context.routeArguments is UlocArguments) {
      return (context.routeArguments as UlocArguments).flutterArguments;
    }
    return context.routeArguments;
  }

  /// Accesses the named `ULoC` arguments passed to the route.
  ///
  /// Returns a `Map<String, dynamic>` if the current route's arguments
  /// are wrapped inside a [UlocArguments] object. Otherwise, returns `null`.
  ///
  /// This is useful for retrieving key-value data passed via `ULoC` routing,
  /// such as query-style parameters or configuration values.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final id = ulocArguments?['id'];
  /// ```
  Map<String, dynamic>? get ulocArguments {
    if (context.routeArguments is UlocArguments) {
      return (context.routeArguments as UlocArguments).argumentsMap;

  /// this will return:
  /// ```dart
  /// {
  ///   "utm_source": "facebook",
  ///   "utm_medium": "social"
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// If a key appears multiple times in the query, its value will be a `List<String>`.
  /// Otherwise, it returns a single `String`.

  /// to access certain inherited providers directly, because they were
  /// defined higher up in the widget tree or within the previous route.
  ///
  /// By storing the previous contexts in `_ancestorContexts`, we can
  /// enable lookup of those older providers manually when needed â€”
  /// helping to maintain consistent business logic, user session state,
  /// or service references across route transitions without having to
  /// reinitialize or duplicate them.
